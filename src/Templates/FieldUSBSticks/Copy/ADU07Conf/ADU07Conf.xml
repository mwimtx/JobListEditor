         setting the nodes value to "adjusted" will shift the complete job-list to the new
         start-time defined in "start_time" and "start_date" nodes
         setting the nodes value to "grid" you may enter a time grid the joblist shall be started
         on (e.g. set start_time to 00:15:00 means start joblist at next full 15 minutes - Example:
         time now: 08:37:42 / start_time: 00:15:00 / resulting joblist start-time: 08:45:00
         time now: 09:02:13 / start_time: 00:15:00 / resulting joblist start-time: 09:15:00
